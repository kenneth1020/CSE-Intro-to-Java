// This program will demonstrate creating and using method

/* Lesson note: Methods allow for reuse of code within the program. 
 * This is a way of separating out code form the main
 *  There will always be two parts to the method
 *  	a method definition - what the method will do
 *  	a call to the method - tell it to do it
