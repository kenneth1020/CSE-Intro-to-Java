//This program will demonstrate various Character methods

/* Lesson note: Characters are based on their Unicode (or
* 	ACSII) code. So their methods treat them like the 
*  numerical equivalent of their ASCII code, as in A = 65.
*  Also note that special characters require an Escape 
*  sequence in order to be displayed The \ is placed in
*  front of the character (\" to display a ")
*  
* The syntax is:
*  	 Character.methodName(arguments)
